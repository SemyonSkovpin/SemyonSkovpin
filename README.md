I been studying python for 1 year. My thesis work in colledge (at CS 3rd year) started one week ago, so currently I'm looking for ideas and directions on what to work on. My main idea is to implement a series of basic machine learning algorithms. I started a short course on ML fundamentals on EdX. Goal: gather theory and finish the course final project. In meantime I might come up with more original projects to use what I learned.
